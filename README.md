VideoComposer is a controllable video diffusion model, which allows users to flexibly control the spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously within a synthesized video in various forms, such as text description, sketch sequence, reference video, or even simply handcrafted motions and handrawings.

## Running by Yourself

### 1. Installation 

Requirements:
- Python==3.8
- ffmpeg (for motion vector extraction)
- torch==1.12.0+cu113
- torchvision==0.13.0+cu113

You also can create a same environment like ours with the following command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

### 2. Download model weights

Download all the [model weights](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/VideoComposer/summary) via the following command:

```
!pip install modelscope
from modelscope.hub.snapshot_download import snapshot_download
model_dir = snapshot_download('damo/VideoComposer', cache_dir='model_weights/', revision='v1.0.0')
```

Next, place these models in the `model_weights` folder following the file structure shown below.


```
|--model_weights/
|    |--non_ema_228000.pth
|    |--midas_v3_dpt_large.pth 
|    |--open_clip_pytorch_model.bin
|    |--sketch_simplification_gan.pth
|    |--table5_pidinet.pth
|    |--v2-1_512-ema-pruned.ckpt
```

You can also download the some of them from their original project: 
- "midas_v3_dpt_large.pth" in [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS)
- "open_clip_pytorch_model.bin" in [Open Clip](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip) 
- "sketch_simplification_gan.pth" and "table5_pidinet.pth" in [Pidinet](https://github.com/zhuoinoulu/pidinet)
- "v2-1_512-ema-pruned.ckpt" in [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base/blob/main/v2-1_512-ema-pruned.ckpt).

For convenience, we provide a download link in this repo.


### 3. Running

In this project, we provide two implementations that can help you better understand our method.


#### 3.1 Inference with Customized Inputs

You can run the code with following command:

```
python run_net.py\
    --cfg configs/exp02_motion_transfer.yaml\
    --seed 9999\
    --input_video "demo_video/motion_transfer.mp4"\
    --image_path "demo_video/moon_on_water.jpg"\
    --input_text_desc "A beautiful big moon on the water at night"
```
The results are saved in the `outputs/exp02_motion_transfer-S09999` folder:

![case1](source/results/exp02_motion_transfer-S00009.gif "case2")
![case2](source/results/exp02_motion_transfer-S09999.gif "case2")


In some cases, if you notice a significant change in color difference, you can use the style condition to adjust the color distribution with the following command. This can be helpful in certain cases.


```
python run_net.py\
    --cfg configs/exp02_motion_transfer_vs_style.yaml\
    --seed 9999\
    --input_video "demo_video/motion_transfer.mp4"\
    --image_path "demo_video/moon_on_water.jpg"\
    --style_image "demo_video/moon_on_water.jpg"\
    --input_text_desc "A beautiful big moon on the water at night"
```


```
python run_net.py\
    --cfg configs/exp03_sketch2video_style.yaml\
    --seed 8888\
    --sketch_path "demo_video/src_single_sketch.png"\
    --style_image "demo_video/style/qibaishi_01.png"\
    --input_text_desc "Red-backed Shrike lanius collurio"
```
![case2](source/results/exp03_sketch2video_style-S09999.gif "case2")



```
python run_net.py\
    --cfg configs/exp04_sketch2video_wo_style.yaml\
    --seed 144\
    --sketch_path "demo_video/src_single_sketch.png"\
    --input_text_desc "A Red-backed Shrike lanius collurio is on the branch"
```
![case2](source/results/exp04_sketch2video_wo_style-S00144.gif "case2")
![case2](source/results/exp04_sketch2video_wo_style-S00144-1.gif "case2")



```
python run_net.py\
    --cfg configs/exp05_text_depths_wo_style.yaml\
    --seed 9999\
    --input_video demo_video/video_8800.mp4\
    --input_text_desc "A glittering and translucent fish swimming in a small glass bowl with multicolored piece of stone, like a glass fish"
```
![case2](source/results/exp05_text_depths_wo_style-S09999-0.gif "case2")
![case2](source/results/exp05_text_depths_wo_style-S09999-2.gif "case2")

```
python run_net.py\
    --cfg configs/exp06_text_depths_vs_style.yaml\
    --seed 9999\
    --input_video demo_video/video_8800.mp4\
    --style_image "demo_video/style/qibaishi_01.png"\
    --input_text_desc "A glittering and translucent fish swimming in a small glass bowl with multicolored piece of stone, like a glass fish"
```

![case2](source/results/exp06_text_depths_vs_style-S09999-0.gif "case2")
![case2](source/results/exp06_text_depths_vs_style-S09999-1.gif "case2")


#### 3.2 Inference on a Video

You can just runing the code with the following command:
```
python run_net.py \
    --cfg configs/exp01_vidcomposer_full.yaml \
    --input_video "demo_video/blackswan.mp4" \
    --input_text_desc "A black swan swam in the water" \
    --seed 9999
```

This command will extract the different conditions, e.g., depth, sketch, motion vectors, of the input video for the following video generation, which are saved in the `outputs` folder. The task list are predefined in <font style="color: rgb(128,128,255)">inference_multi.py</font>. 



In addition to the above use cases, you can explore further possibilities with this code and model. Please note that due to the diversity of generated samples by the diffusion model, you can explore different seeds to generate better results. 

We hope you enjoy using it! &#x1F600;

## Disclaimer

This open-source model is trained on the [WebVid-10M](https://m-bain.github.io/webvid-dataset/) and [LAION-400M](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-400-open-dataset/) datasets and is intended for <strong>RESEARCH/NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY</strong>. We have also trained more powerful models using internal video data, which can be used in future.
